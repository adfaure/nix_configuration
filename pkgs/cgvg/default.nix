      cgvg is a pair of Perl scripts ("cg" and "vg") which are meant to assist a programmer in doing command-line source browsing.

      The idea is you can easily search for keywords in the code, and jump to the file and line where a match is found. Used with ctags(1), this can really help with jumping around and following code. Some features include a human-readable output, coloring, bolding (and alternate bolding), and just sheer convenience for a programmer.

      cgvg uses the Perl internal find and does its own searching, rather than being a wrapper for UNIX find(1) and grep(1). There is a ~/.cgvgrc file for per-user configuration, and some nice features like coloring, and multiple log files.
